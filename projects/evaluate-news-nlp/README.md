# Project Instructions
## Functionality
This repo takes the starter code from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/evaluate-news-nlp) and extends it with the following functionality:
* Webpack is set up and configured
* Sass styles are added
* Webpack Loaders and Plugins are added
* Service worker is added to cache the website
* Use of Aylien API
* Added plugin to show the node tree (this comes up when dev mode is launched)

## Instructions on how to use the website
* This website takes the user input and runs a sentiment analysis on it
* In this case short sentences (tweets) are expected as user input
* After the tweet is entered and submitted, the website will display if the tweet is positive, negative or neutral. It will also display how confident this output value is and if it is written from a subjective or objective perspective.
